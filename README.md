# CSCI4810-Graphics-FinalProject

Thomas Horn & Patrick Feltey

## Introduction

This final project is a video game maze that implements all techniques learned in CSCI4810 Graphics as well as independently learned techniques.

Although this project includes things such as raycasting, custom shaders, manual matrix translations/transpositions, the main goal of the project was to use
vanilla THREEJS to create a raycasting based collision system to constrain our player within the maze, rather than rely on a physics or collision system dependency.
